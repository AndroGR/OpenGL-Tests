# Particle Emitter
This is a small particle emitter engine written in OpenGL. It is pretty barebones however it is going to be used in my next game. There is a significant advantage on performance compared to other particle systems thanks to its minimal design.

# Running
Run these two commands:
```sh
$ make -j`nproc`
$ make run
```
